# Label Taxonomy

LifePilot uses a structured label system so issues and pull requests are triageable at a glance. Labels are grouped by prefix; each issue should carry at most one label from each group.

## `type:` - what kind of work this is

| Label | Color | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `type: bug` | `#d73a4a` | A defect in existing behavior |
| `type: feature` | `#0e8a16` | A new capability |

New labels should be proposed via pull request against this file before being created in the repository, so the taxonomy stays documented and intentional.
