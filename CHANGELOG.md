# Changelog

All notable changes to LifePilot are documented in this file.

The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and versioning follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) as described in [Release Strategy](docs/ENGINEERING_GUIDE.md#release-strategy).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Interactive web demo at `Website/public/` with GitHub Pages and Vercel deployment.
- Phase 3 SwiftUI foundation: seven SPM targets, design system, mock-driven screens.
- `TimelineProviding` protocol; `Features` no longer imports `LifePilotMocks` directly.

### Changed

- Removed legacy `demo/` folder and duplicate `Core/GhostBrain.swift` placeholder.
- `release.yml` builds via `swift build` instead of a non-existent Xcode scheme.
- Updated `MASTER_ROADMAP.md`, `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, and README demo links.

### Added (foundation)

- Full repository engineering foundation: issue templates, PR template, CI/CD workflows, branch protection documentation.
- Core documentation set: `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, `MASTER_ROADMAP.md`, `docs/PRODUCT_VISION.md`, `docs/DESIGN_SYSTEM.md`, `docs/ENGINEERING_GUIDE.md`, `docs/API_GUIDELINES.md`, `docs/STYLE_GUIDE.md`, `docs/DECISIONS.md`.
- `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, `SECURITY.md`.
- Brand identity: LifePilot logo and mark under `Assets/brand/`.
- Enterprise-grade `README.md` landing page.
- First buildable target: `Package.swift` defining the `LifePilotCore` library (`Core/`) and its test target (`Tests/Core/`), unblocking CI's Build, Unit Tests, and SwiftLint checks.
- `.swiftlint.yml` and `.swiftformat` configuration, tuned to `docs/STYLE_GUIDE.md`.
- `MASTER_ROADMAP.md`: an 11-phase (0–10) master roadmap with full technical/UX requirements, risks, dependencies, and GitHub workflow per phase, superseding the earlier `ROADMAP.md`.
- Animated and static architecture diagrams (`Assets/brand/architecture.svg`) illustrating the Ghost Brain reasoning pipeline.
