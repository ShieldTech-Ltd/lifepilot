# Architecture

This document describes LifePilot's system architecture: how the codebase is organized, how layers depend on one another, how the AI agent system is structured, and how the design scales as the product grows.

## System Overview

LifePilot is structured as a layered system: signal collection at the edges, reasoning at the core, and execution gated behind explicit human approval. This is a direct expression of the product's core loop - **Observe → Understand → Predict → Prepare → Explain → Approve → Execute → Learn** - described in the [README](../README.md#core-philosophy).

Three properties fall directly out of this diagram:

1. **The Ghost Brain is the only component that reasons across domains.** Agents reason within their domain and report structured findings upward; only the Ghost Brain fuses them into one model of "today."
2. **No path reaches Execution without passing through Approval.** This is enforced in code, not just in the UI - see [Dependency Rules](#dependency-rules).
3. **Connected Apps are adapters, not sources of truth for meaning.** LifePilot never forks the user's data model; it reads from and writes back to the systems of record.

```

Each first-class module (`Core`, `Agents`, `DesignSystem`, `Features`, `Services`) is expected to be internally organized by feature, not by file type - e.g. `Agents/CalendarAgent/CalendarAgent.swift`, `Agents/CalendarAgent/CalendarSignal.swift`, `Agents/CalendarAgent/Tests/`, rather than a flat `Models/`, `Views/`, `Controllers/` split at the top level.

The root `Package.swift` currently builds `Core` as the `LifePilotCore` library target - the first buildable unit, giving CI a real target ahead of the full iOS app (tracked in [#4](https://github.com/TFT444/LifePilot/issues/4)). `packages/` remains reserved for domain logic *extracted* from `Core` once it outgrows a single target, per [ADR-005](DECISIONS.md#adr-005-protocol-first-module-boundaries) - the two are not redundant, just different stages of the same growth path.

## Layered Architecture

LifePilot follows a strict layering model. Each layer may depend only on the layers below it.

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    subgraph L4["Presentation Layer"]
        F[Features]
        DS[DesignSystem]
    end
    subgraph L3["Domain Layer"]
        C[Core / Ghost Brain]
        AG[Agents]
    end
    subgraph L2["Service Layer"]
        S[Services]
    end
    subgraph L1["Platform Layer"]
        INT["Integrations - CloudKit, WeatherKit, MapKit, Supabase, OpenAI"]
    end

    F --> C
    F --> DS
    C --> AG
    AG --> S
    S --> INT
```

| Layer | Responsibility | May depend on |
|---|---|---|
| **Presentation** (`Features`, `DesignSystem`) | Renders UI, handles user interaction, presents Ghost Brain output. | Domain layer only. Never talks to Services or Integrations directly. |
| **Domain** (`Core`, `Agents`) | Reasoning, prediction, and domain modeling. Framework-agnostic. | Service layer, via protocols. |
| **Service** (`Services`) | Cross-cutting infrastructure: networking, persistence, auth, logging. | Platform layer. |
| **Platform** (`Integrations`) | Thin adapters around external SDKs and APIs. | Nothing above it. |

## Dependency Rules

1. **Dependencies point downward only.** `Features` may import `Core`; `Core` must never import `Features`. Circular dependencies between modules are a build failure, not a style preference.
2. **The Domain layer is UI-framework-agnostic.** `Core` and `Agents` contain no `import SwiftUI`. This keeps the reasoning engine testable in isolation and portable to a future non-Apple surface if the product ever requires it.
3. **Agents communicate only through the Ghost Brain.** `Agents/CalendarAgent` never directly calls `Agents/EmailAgent`. Cross-agent context flows through `Core`, so the reasoning graph stays inspectable and testable as a whole.
4. **Execution is gated by construction.** The type that represents an "approved action" is only constructible from a successful Approval flow - see [Core Philosophy](../README.md#core-philosophy) and the Security Agent's role in [AI Agent Architecture](#ai-agent-architecture). There is no code path that produces a side effect without passing through that type.
5. **Integrations are swappable.** `Services` depends on protocols, not concrete SDK types, so `OpenAI`, `Supabase`, or `CloudKit` can be replaced or mocked without touching `Core` or `Agents`.

## AI Agent Architecture

Each agent is a self-contained unit that reasons within one domain and reports structured, typed findings to the Ghost Brain. This mirrors the [AI Agent System](../README.md#ai-agent-system) described in the README, with the following structural contract:

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Agent {
        <<protocol>>
        +observe() SignalList
        +predict(context) PredictionList
    }
    class GhostBrain {
        +fuse(predictions) DayModel
        +rank(recommendations) RankedRecommendations
    }
    class SecurityAgent {
        +audit(action) RiskAssessment
    }
    class ApprovalGate {
        +request(action) ApprovedAction
    }

    Agent <|-- CalendarAgent
    Agent <|-- EmailAgent
    Agent <|-- TravelAgent
    Agent <|-- FinanceAgent
    Agent <|-- MemoryAgent
    Agent <|-- ReminderAgent
    Agent <|-- ShoppingAgent
    Agent <|-- HealthAgent

    GhostBrain --> Agent : fuses output of
    GhostBrain --> SecurityAgent : requests audit
    SecurityAgent --> ApprovalGate : gates
    ApprovalGate --> GhostBrain : returns ApprovedAction
```

Each agent implements a common `Agent` protocol (`observe()`, `predict(context:)`), which means:

- New agents can be added without modifying the Ghost Brain's core fusion logic.
- Every agent is independently unit-testable, with the Ghost Brain mocked as a simple context object.
- The `SecurityAgent` is architecturally distinct from domain agents - it doesn't propose actions, it audits *other agents'* proposed actions before they reach the Approval Gate. This keeps the "is this action safe" question centralized and auditable rather than duplicated per-agent.

See the [README's AI Agent System](../README.md#ai-agent-system) for what each agent is responsible for at the product level.

## Future Scalability

The layering and agent contracts above are designed to absorb three kinds of future growth without rearchitecting:

- **New agents.** Home, Social, and Work agents can be added by implementing `Agent` and registering with the Ghost Brain - no changes to `Features` or `DesignSystem` required.
- **New surfaces.** Because `Core` and `Agents` are UI-framework-agnostic, a future web dashboard (`Website/`) or other client can reuse the same reasoning engine through a thin API layer rather than reimplementing it.
- **New integrations.** Because `Services` depends on protocols rather than concrete SDKs, swapping or adding a data source (e.g. a new calendar provider) touches one adapter, not the reasoning core.

As the codebase grows past what a single `Core` module can comfortably hold, domain logic will be extracted into local Swift Packages under `packages/`, each with its own tests and versioned independently - without changing the dependency rules above.
